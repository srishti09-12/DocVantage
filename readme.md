# **MultiPDF & Web Chat App**

## **Overview**

The MultiPDF & Web Chat App is a powerful Python-based tool that allows you to interact with multiple data sources using natural language. You can upload PDFs, perform web searches, or analyze datasets, and the app will intelligently process your input to generate meaningful responses. Leveraging advanced language models and embeddings, this app ensures accurate and context-aware answers tailored to your queries.

---

## **Features**

- **Chat with Multiple PDFs**: Upload multiple PDF documents and query their content seamlessly.
- **Web Search Integration**: Perform web searches directly from the app, extract relevant information, and get insightful responses.
- **Dataset Analysis**: Upload CSV files to explore, analyze, and visualize your data interactively.
- **Customizable and Extensible**: Built with modular components for easy adaptation and scaling.

1. **Data Loading**:

   - **PDFs**: Extracts text content from uploaded PDFs.
   - **Web**: Scrapes web content for user-specified queries.
   - **Datasets**: Parses and loads CSV files for interactive analysis.

2. **Text Chunking**:

   - Divides the extracted text into manageable chunks for efficient processing and contextual understanding.

3. **Embedding Generation**:

   - Uses state-of-the-art transformer models to compute vector representations (embeddings) for text chunks.

4. **Similarity Matching**:

   - Employs cosine similarity to identify chunks most relevant to your query.

5. **Response Generation**:

   - Utilizes advanced language models like GPT or Ollama to synthesize accurate, context-aware responses.

6. **Interactive Interface**:
   - Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and responsive user experience.

## **Usage Guide**

### **PDF Chat**

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Upload one or more PDFs using the sidebar.
3. Once processed, ask questions related to the PDFs in the chat interface.

### **Web Query Chat**

1. Enter a search query in the sidebar under the "Web Query" section.
2. Process the query to fetch and analyze the web content.
3. Interact with the chat interface to ask detailed questions about the retrieved content.

### **Dataset Analysis**

1. Upload a CSV file in the "Dataset Visualization" section.
2. Explore the data or ask questions to perform visual or textual analyses.
